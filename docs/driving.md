# Scenarios

Currently the tested scenarios are the experimental
suites defined on the benchmarks repository.
https://github.com/carla-simulator/driving-benchmarks

Here we use the same strategy for evaluating as showed
on the https://github.com/carla-simulator/driving-benchmarks
However, we split the benchmarks a bit more in order to
perform the evaluation quickier.

### Output format

Inside the _logs/<exp_batch>/<exp_file> folder
some folders containing the csv output.
